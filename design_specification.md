# Project Design Specification: Intentionally Terrible Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
A single-page website that demonstrates AI prompting and direction skills through deliberate anti-design. The site showcases the ability to guide an LLM to create purposefully bad UX/UI while maintaining a coherent creative vision.

**Target Audience:** Potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in AI collaboration and creative prompting skills.

**Core Concept:** A hilariously terrible website that transforms into a professional portfolio, proving the chaos was intentional and strategic.

## Typography Specifications

### Primary Font Pairing (Intentionally Horrible)
- **Headings:** Comic Sans MS
  - All major section titles
  - Hero name/title
  - Navigation elements (if any)
  
- **Body Text:** Papyrus
  - All paragraph content
  - Descriptions
  - Form labels

- **Accent/Special Text:** Mix randomly between:
  - Impact (for "important" callouts)
  - Brush Script MT (for testimonials)
  - Courier New (for "code" references)
  - Times New Roman (sprinkled randomly)

### Typography Rules
- Font sizes should vary wildly (12px to 72px with no logical hierarchy)
- Random use of ALL CAPS, Title Case, and lowercase
- Mix bold, italic, and underline unpredictably
- Letter spacing should be uncomfortable (too tight or too loose)
- Line height should create awkward text blocks

## Interactive Elements & Animations

- Blinking text (via CSS animation)
- Rotating elements (skill icons, profile photo)
- Bouncing buttons
- Particle effects (sparkles, stars)
- Cursor trails
- Pop-ups that spawn more pop-ups

### User Interaction Patterns (Anti-UX):
- Buttons that move on hover
- Forms that reset when you mistype
- Links with misleading labels
- Scroll hijacking (if subtle enough to be funny, not rage-inducing)
- Right-click disabled with "Nice try!" alert
- Auto-refreshing sections
- Progress bars that go backwards

---

## Technical Requirements

### Must Have:
- Single HTML page (can have CSS and JS files)
- Responsive (but breaks hilariously on mobile)
- Fast load time despite appearing broken
- Accessible transformation button (for the reveal)
- Works in modern browsers
- No actual data collection (fake form)

### Nice to Have:
- Local storage to remember if user found the transformation
- Konami code Easter egg
- Sound effects on clicks (annoying)
- Print stylesheet that makes it worse
- Meta tags that are joke descriptions

---

## Content Tone & Voice

**Terrible Version:**
- Overly enthusiastic with excessive punctuation!!!
- Corporate buzzword salad
- Inconsistent perspective (switching between first and third person)
- Random tangents
- Obvious typos left in intentionally
- Self-aggrandizing but vague

**Professional Version (After Transformation):**
- Clear, confident, competent
- Explains the artistic/strategic vision
- Documents the AI collaboration process
- Demonstrates actual technical and creative skills

---

## Success Metrics

This project successfully demonstrates:
1. **AI Direction Skills:** Every terrible choice is documented as intentional
2. **Technical Competence:** The transformation proves you can build proper websites
3. **Creative Vision:** The cohesive awfulness shows strategic thinking
4. **Humor & Self-Awareness:** The concept itself is the portfolio piece

---

## Implementation Notes for Developer

When prompting the LLM to build this:
- Be specific about which elements should be terrible and how
- Request inline CSS for maximum chaos (though external sheet is fine)
- Ask for commented code explaining the intentional anti-patterns
- Ensure the transformation mechanism is smooth and impressive
- Keep the reveal content professional and genuinely portfolio-worthy
- Test that the terrible version is funny, not actually frustrating

---

## Final Deliverable Checklist

- [ ] Single-page HTML file
- [ ] Intentionally terrible design fully implemented
- [ ] All 8 sections present with required content
- [ ] Secret transformation button/trigger functional
- [ ] Professional version with portfolio documentation
- [ ] Commented code explaining design choices
- [ ] Mobile responsive (badly on purpose, then well)
- [ ] No broken functionality (only appears broken)
- [ ] README, documentation and the conversation used to create it

**Project Motto:** "Making bad websites on purpose is harder than making good ones by accident."
