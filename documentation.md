## Key Insights from This Conversation

### Prompting Techniques Demonstrated

1. **Progressive Refinement**
   - Started with high-level concept ("prank website")
   - Refined to specific purpose ("AI collaboration portfolio")
   - Narrowed to concrete specifications
   - Executed implementation

2. **Context Building**
   - Initial prompt established role ("project strategist")
   - Follow-up clarified purpose and audience
   - Each exchange built on previous understanding

3. **Structured Approach**
   - Strategy → Sections → Specification → Implementation
   - Broke large project into manageable steps

4. **Iterative Development**
   - Created specification document first
   - Used specification to guide implementation

5. **Clear Direction**
   - Specific requirements ("Comic Sans + Papyrus")
   - Concrete examples ("skill bars exceeding 100%")
   - Explicit constraints and success criteria

## Prompt Engineering Lessons

### What Worked Well

✅ **Starting Broad, Then Narrowing**
- "Prank website" → "AI collaboration demo" → specific sections

✅ **Building Context**
- Each prompt referenced previous conversation
- Built shared understanding over time

✅ **Specific Examples**
- "Comic Sans" vs "bad fonts"
- "Skill bars exceeding 100%" vs "broken design"

✅ **Requesting Formats**
- "Create a specification document"
- "Build this for me"
- Clear output expectations

### Techniques to Note

**Role Assignment:**
- "Act as a project strategist"
- Sets context for type of response

**Constraint Specification:**
- "One page website"
- "Simple readme"
- Clear boundaries

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Didn't request everything at once
- Let each artifact inform the next

**Feedback Integration:**
- AI adjusted based on user preferences
